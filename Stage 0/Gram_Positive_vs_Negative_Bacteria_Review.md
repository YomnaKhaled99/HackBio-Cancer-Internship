# **Gram Positive vs. Negative Bacteria**

Author (@slack): Yomna Khaled (@yomna98)

Bacteria are ubiquitous microscopic unicellular prokaryotes, essential for various vital processes in the environment and inside living organisms \[[1](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Bacteria)]. Bacteria can be classified into two major types, gram positive and gram negative, according to their cell wall structure \[[2](https://open.oregonstate.education/generalmicrobiology/chapter/bacteria-cell-walls/)].

## **Bacterial Cell Wall**

The bacterial cell wall is an envelope that surrounds the bacteria, protecting them against undesirable circumstances. Moreover, bacteria use this envelope to reproduce, move, and selectively exchange nutrients and wastes with their surrounding environment. Cell wall structure is a key difference between the gram positive and gram negative bacteria \[[3](https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a000414)]. Gram negative bacteria have an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharide and a thin inner membrane made of peptidoglycan, a complex polysaccharide polymer that stabilizes and maintains the shape of the cell wall<sup> </sup>\[[4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3486-x)]. On the other hand, gram positive bacteria have only the inner peptidoglycan membrane; however, it is thicker than that of the gram negative ones and contains teichoic acid<sup> </sup>\[[2](https://open.oregonstate.education/generalmicrobiology/chapter/bacteria-cell-walls/),[3](https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a000414)].

## **Gram Staining**

Gram staining is an established technique used to differentiate between the gram positive and gram negative bacteria. First, the bacterial cells are treated with crystal violet dye and iodine to form a crystal violet-iodine complex for dye fixation. Then, a decolorizer, such as ethanol, is added for dye removal<sup> </sup>\[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562156/#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20of%20gram,higher%20lipid%20content.%5B4%5D)]. During this step, the lipid layer of the gram negative bacteria is dissolved, and the crystal violet-iodine complex escapes their thin peptidoglycan membrane, while the thick membrane of gram positive bacteria keeps this complex retrained. Finally, the cells are soaked in safranin counterstain for a while and rinsed with water. The gram negative bacteria will eventually appear red under a microscope, whereas the gram positive ones will appear purple<sup> </sup>\[[6](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/articles/gram-positive-vs-gram-negative-323007)].

## **Sensitivity to antibiotics**

Antibiotics have different mechanisms to attack gram positive and negative bacteria; however, some bacteria can escape them. Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious life-threatening issues, where microorganisms no longer respond to antibiotics. The outer membrane of the gram negative bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, plays a crucial role in their antibiotic resistance. On the contrary, gram positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus pneumoniae, are more susceptible to antibiotics<sup> </sup>\[[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25061340)].

## **Conclusion**

The cell wall of gram positive and negative bacteria provides them with mechanical support needed for their communication and survival. These two types of bacteria can be differentiated with gram staining based on their ability of their cell wall to retrain the crystal violet dye during the procedure. Gram negative bacteria are more pathogenic to humans than gram positive ones.
